## First Verse

In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

In twilight's embrace, the stars ignite,  
Whispers of dreams paint the canvas of night.  
Through realms of shadows, a lone moon sighs,  
Echoes of silence, where secrets arise.  
 
Beneath the boughs, where whispers dwell,  
The dance of leaves, a silent spell.  
In murmured winds, a tale untold,  
Where mysteries linger, and truths unfold.  

Upon the shores, where waves doth roam,  
Whispers of ancient songs find home.  
In sands of time, each grain a story,  
Bound by fate, in endless glory.  

Through fields of gold, where memories roam,  
Echoes of laughter find their home.  
In petals soft, a fragrance divine,  
A symphony of senses, a moment's shrine.  

In city streets, where lights collide,  
Echoes of footsteps, dreams abide.  
Through alleyways, where shadows play,  
Whispers of hope pave the way.  

In hearts that ache, where sorrows lie,  
Echoes of love refuse to die.  
Through trials faced, and battles won,  
Whispers of courage, beneath the sun.  

In the depths of soul, where passions soar,  
Echoes of longing, forevermore.  
Through the labyrinth of desire's flight,  
Whispers of ecstasy, in the still of night.
