## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->


A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  


## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In twilight's embrace, the stars ignite,  
Whispers of dreams paint the canvas of night.  
Through realms of shadows, a lone moon sighs,  
Echoes of silence, where secrets arise.  
 
Beneath the boughs, where whispers dwell,  
The dance of leaves, a silent spell.  
In murmured winds, a tale untold,  
Where mysteries linger, and truths unfold.  

Upon the shores, where waves doth roam,  
Whispers of ancient songs find home.  
In sands of time, each grain a story,  
Bound by fate, in endless glory.  

Through fields of gold, where memories roam,  
Echoes of laughter find their home.  
In petals soft, a fragrance divine,  
A symphony of senses, a moment's shrine.  

In city streets, where lights collide,  
Echoes of footsteps, dreams abide.  
Through alleyways, where shadows play,  
Whispers of hope pave the way.  

In hearts that ache, where sorrows lie,  
Echoes of love refuse to die.  
Through trials faced, and battles won,  
Whispers of courage, beneath the sun.  

In the depths of soul, where passions soar,  
Echoes of longing, forevermore.  
Through the labyrinth of desire's flight,  
Whispers of ecstasy, in the still of night.
